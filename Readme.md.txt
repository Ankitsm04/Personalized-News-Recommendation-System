# 📰 Personalized News Recommendation System

A *Reinforcement Learning-based interactive news recommendation system built with **Policy Gradients and DQN. The app uses **click behavior* to learn and recommend news articles using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and is deployed via *Gradio* for real-time interaction.

## 🧠 How it Works

1. The app starts by showing 5 news recommendations.
2. When a user *clicks* on an article, a reward is assigned.
3. This action is recorded in the *Replay Buffer*.
4. The *DQN model* is trained on these actions to improve future recommendations.
5. The next batch of top articles is displayed based on updated Q-values.
